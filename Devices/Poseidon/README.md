# Poseidon
Emulation guide for the Poseidon System.

## Overview
[Poseidon](https://github.com/pachterlab/poseidon) is an open-source system consisting of two components:
1. Syringe pump(s). Syringe pumps are driven by an Arduino chip with a CNC shield;
2. Microscope. The microscope is a simple webcam connected to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi also doubles as a console for the syringe pump, although this role may be substituted by any computer.
